# Project Overview

Project Name: Martian Pizza Soundscape

Description: A whimsical take on the "Echo Chamber" concept: A web application where users contribute sounds to create collaborative audio environments, with a playful focus on pizza-related sounds and a mocked deployment to Mars.

Features:

*   Sound Recording/Uploading (Mocked): Users can "record" or "upload" sound clips (pre-selected pizza sounds will be available for a fun twist).
*   Collaborative Soundscape: These sounds blend into a shared, evolving audio environment.
*   Pizza Oven Sound: Include a distinct "pizza oven" sound element in the soundscape.
*   Geographic Mocking: Focus on a specific Martian "neighborhood" soundscape.
*   Mars Deployment Visualization: A fun, animated sequence that "deploys" the app to a mocked Martian landscape.
*   No-Code Interface: Aim for a very simple, intuitive interface.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
